[Music]

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,880
hardly anyone can dispute that james

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,279
cameron's avatar changed the 3d cinema

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,440
experience forever when it was released

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,639
over 11 years ago

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,080
many thought the franchise was dead

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,320
until recently but behind the scenes

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,599
they've been busy all these years

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,520
working on sequels if all goes as

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,279
planned we will get the sequel to the

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:19,920
officially

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,000
most successful movie of the time next

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,840
year in december in order to make sure

14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,199
you don't lose track of things until

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:25,680
then

16
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359
we have compiled the most important

17
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,199
information about avatar 2

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,199
and today we would like to give you

19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,719
loads of reasons why we're looking

20
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
forward to this mega blockbuster

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
however before we get to part 2 let's

22
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,760
rewind to the very beginning

23
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
after all what was the first part of

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
avatar all about this plot summary will

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
inevitably contain some spoilers since

26
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,440
we won't get into the storyline of

27
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,200
avatar 2 until afterwards

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,199
the plot basically revolves around jake

29
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,840
sully born in 2126 who joined the

30
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,120
marines at a young age

31
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,719
and was so severely wounded that he

32
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,879
became paralyzed from the waist down

33
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,399
actually not a good starting condition

34
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
to explore an alien planet however a

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:02,960
tragic

36
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,959
incident causes him to travel to pandora

37
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,479
instead of his twin brother

38
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,000
after triumph sleeping aboard a

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,080
spacecraft for several years he finally

40
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
arises on the beautiful and pristine

41
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
planet with a few other humans

42
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,759
and is briefed on the details of his

43
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,680
mission to mingle with the natives of

44
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
navi and discover their weaknesses

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,680
behind the whole operation is the

46
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
resources development administration or

47
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
rda for short they in turn are pretty

48
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,799
keen on the raw material on obtainium

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,560
which is found in large quantities on

50
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,280
pandora

51
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
since the human organism on the alien

52
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,320
planet is anything but

53
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
viable the rda has come up with

54
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,600
something extraordinary

55
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
the talk is about a scientific project

56
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,600
that has created a genetically modified

57
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,960
hybrid of human dna

58
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,920
and navi dna these so-called avatars can

59
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,439
be controlled by humans using their

60
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,119
human brain and any nerve endings

61
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,399
connected to the avatar

62
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
for jake in particular this is truly an

63
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,640
out of this world experience because in

64
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
this avatar body he doesn't feel the

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
impact of his paraplegia

66
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
and is thus capable of moving freely

67
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,240
already during his first exploration

68
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,119
mission however

69
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,799
things go wrong and he gets separated

70
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,880
from his group soon he faces a pack of

71
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,119
viper wolves and defends himself in what

72
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,440
should be a hopeless fight to his luck a

73
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
native navy woman comes to his aid and

74
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,000
chases the dangerous animals away

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
jake is immediately fascinated by the

76
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
beautiful navi who bears the name of

77
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
nitiri

78
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
he quickly learns about the customs and

79
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
culture of the navi people and finds

80
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,160
himself in a fateful dilemma

81
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,000
as the more he learns about nathiri and

82
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
her way of life the more irresolute he

83
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
becomes about his mission as a result

84
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,800
jake must decide on whose side he's on

85
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
as either way the fate of the usually

86
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,840
peace-loving people

87
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,440
rests with him now you should have

88
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
somewhat brushed up on your knowledge

89
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
regarding the first part as we mentioned

90
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,040
earlier

91
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,599
avatar set off a real 3d hype back then

92
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,440
which is why the film often has to put

93
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
up with the accusation that moviegoers

94
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,280
only went to the movies due to its 3d

95
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,360
and not because of the plot the fact

96
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
though that star director james cameron

97
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,959
has a lot more up his sleeve becomes

98
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,319
apparent when you realize

99
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,040
that the 66 year old has planned no less

100
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,760
than

101
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,840
four sequels for the franchise

102
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
let's now turn your attention to the

103
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
possible plot of avatar 2.

104
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,800
after the brilliant end of the first

105
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,959
part humans were successfully expelled

106
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,920
from pandora

107
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,000
slowly but surely peace returns to the

108
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,159
almost colonized navi and jake has now

109
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,599
fully become one of them

110
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,000
nearly 13 years after the first parts

111
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and he has even brought off spring into

112
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,720
the world

113
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
namely his children nitiam lowak and

114
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,000
tuktiri

115
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920
in addition to his role as a father he

116
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,319
now has a more laid back routine and so

117
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,680
he and his wife nathiri

118
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,840
set off to explore all the splendor of

119
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,040
the wonderful planet

120
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,640
in the process they not only find

121
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,480
themselves in the beautiful primal

122
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
forest of pandora but also in the

123
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
equally enchanting and dangerous

124
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,599
underwater world

125
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,760
in the oceans as to be expected the

126
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,080
human occupants do not surrender easily

127
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,239
and so they arm themselves for a renewed

128
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,840
attack on the resources and the

129
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,519
population of pandora

130
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,080
oh by the way producer john landauer is

131
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,519
sure that you will be able to watch

132
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,159
avatar

133
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
2 without any prior knowledge from the

134
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,439
first avatar movie

135
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,280
so it will not be essential to watch the

136
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
whole movie again

137
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,560
our summary of part 1 is therefore more

138
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,319
than enough

139
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
what's interesting is that even before

140
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the first part came out director cameron

141
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,599
announced that he wanted at least two

142
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,880
sequels to follow

143
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,798
success proved him right with one of the

144
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,959
most expensive productions in film

145
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,560
history at the time and after the

146
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
blockbuster quickly rose to the top as

147
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,040
the most successful movie of all time

148
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
it became obvious that sooner or later

149
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
the sequel was to follow

150
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
planned were so-called back to back

151
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
shoots in new zealand for the respective

152
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
scripts of avatar 2 to 4 cameron hired

153
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
different screenwriters and designed

154
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,840
each of them

155
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,919
a film of their own that's how josh

156
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,759
friedman ended up writing part 2 rick

157
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,520
jeff and amanda silva part 3

158
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,479
and shane salerno part 4. only part 5 is

159
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,080
currently missing a screenwriter

160
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
james cameron who's certainly not a man

161
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
of few words also announced that he

162
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
would like to use footage from the

163
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,800
mariana trench

164
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,560
the deepest point on earth as a

165
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
reference for the underwater world of

166
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,039
pandora

167
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,440
in terms of 3d technology cameron also

168
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
announced nothing less than revolution

169
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,919
one innovation is to shoot the sequences

170
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,919
at 60 frames per second to achieve

171
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,520
better and above all

172
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
smoother 3d moreover there are

173
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,360
persistent rumors that avatar 2 is going

174
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,199
to be screened in 3d without the need

175
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,080
for glasses

176
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,560
and that would be nothing less than a

177
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,840
new 3d revolution

178
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,360
the problem with this is that it would

179
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
require upgrading almost every movie

180
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,160
theater

181
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,080
in the world to the new technology by

182
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
investing a large sum of money

183
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,560
a pretty unlikely scenario especially in

184
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,600
light of the pandemic

185
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
and the lack of revenue while cameron is

186
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,479
and remains one of the great visionaries

187
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,600
in the movie business

188
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
we can only hope that avatar 2 will not

189
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
only feature great 3d technology

190
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,759
but also a captivating plot

191
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,800
moving on to the cast of avatar 2. of

192
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
course several familiar faces will be

193
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
making a comeback including of course

194
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
samworthiness jake and zoe zeldana as

195
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,319
natiori

196
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,319
likewise joining the cast are sigoni

197
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,479
weaver as dr grace augustine stephen

198
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,400
lang as colonel miles quarage matt

199
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,120
gerald as

200
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,199
corporal lyle waynflete and giovanni

201
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
ripsey as park selfridge

202
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,960
for some of them the question is

203
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,639
certainly appropriate as to

204
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,479
how exactly their presence is going to

205
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,319
look like in part 2 because not all of

206
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
them made it out of the big battle in

207
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,440
the first part alive

208
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,759
much more exciting are the new cast

209
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,360
members though because as you would

210
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,199
expect from a big hollywood blockbuster

211
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,479
they are quite impressive

212
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,400
so far the cast includes vin diesel in

213
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,639
an as yet unknown role titanic actress

214
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,560
kate winslet asked the aquatic ronald

215
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,360
and michelle joe as dr karina moog addie

216
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
falco has been signed up for the

217
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
villainous role of general admore

218
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,479
cliff curtis plays the leader of the

219
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
madqueena clan jermaine clement becomes

220
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,680
scientist dr

221
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,160
ian garvin and david thulas shows up as

222
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,400
a new character named palak

223
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,960
all in all a respectable cast that'll

224
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,560
possibly be expanded by a few more names

225
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,319
for a couple of years already various

226
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,759
titles of the sequels have been

227
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,160
circulating in the avatar fan community

228
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
as is considered highly unlikely that

229
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,400
the movie will just be called avatar 2.

230
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
back in 2018 the british news channel

231
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,479
bbc brought up four possible titles

232
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,160
which even today have neither been

233
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,039
denied nor

234
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,880
confirmed so there are four titles for

235
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
the four sequels although it's not known

236
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
which title is for

237
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
which sequel the first one mentioned is

238
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,919
avatar the way of water

239
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,240
and could fit well to part 2 but also to

240
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
part 3 due to the water theme

241
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
after all both sequels are supposed to

242
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
focus on the underwater world another

243
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,199
possible title is

244
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,759
avatar the seat bearer this could be a

245
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,599
reference to the seeds of the tree of

246
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,520
souls as this is considered pandora's

247
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
holiest sight and was heavily

248
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,400
responsible for the complete

249
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,240
transformation of jake's soul to his

250
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,520
avatar body

251
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,240
the next title is avatara the token

252
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,960
rider

253
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,879
so far nothing is known about the so

254
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,720
called talking in the avatar franchise

255
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
but the term toku can be found in

256
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,240
buddhism meaning something like a

257
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,080
reincarnated person who passes on his

258
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
knowledge to new generations

259
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
in connection with the word ryder it

260
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,520
could of course also simply be a new

261
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
living bean on pandora

262
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,000
the last title is called avatar the

263
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
quest for ewa ewa is the deity of the

264
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
navy who connects all beings across the

265
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
planet and generally stands for the life

266
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,000
energy of

267
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
pandora thus one could possibly go on a

268
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
quest for awa in the sequel because

269
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,960
in the parts before life has gone

270
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,919
extinct in an

271
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,000
alarming way and the planet's decay is

272
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
imminent another possibility could be

273
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
that one must solve a certain task for

274
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,319
awhile at this point we can only

275
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,120
speculate

276
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,039
what do you think are the titles

277
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,640
credible and which title would you

278
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,000
assign to which sequel

279
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
feel free to discuss this in the comment

280
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
section

281
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,159
to the delight of many fans producer

282
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,240
john landa regularly posts updates and

283
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,839
behind the scenes footage on his

284
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,680
instagram account there you can see all

285
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
kinds of technically sophisticated

286
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,959
shooting work which shows various

287
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,040
underwater vehicles some concept art and

288
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
snapshots with actors in front of the

289
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
camera discussing every single picture

290
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,200
would surely go beyond the scope here

291
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
because meanwhile there are a vast

292
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
number of shots that are all worth a

293
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,279
look

294
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
in january for example we have the

295
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,760
pleasure of seeing a beautiful med kyina

296
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,959
village on the water

297
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,959
although unfortunately it was concept

298
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
art and not a scene from the film

299
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,279
another example from last october shows

300
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,959
a fully equipped high-tech

301
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,440
rda laboratory a final example from

302
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,040
august 2020 illustrates

303
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
quite well the immense amount of work

304
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,279
involved in shooting the mammoth project

305
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,920
as here you can see part of the film set

306
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
in a large hall in new zealand

307
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,440
all customized according to james

308
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,200
cameron's ideas of course

309
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
all the more excited many fans are

310
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,680
waiting for a trailer for avatar 2.

311
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,839
unfortunately there are no clues as to

312
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,040
when a trailer or

313
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
at least a teaser might appear but given

314
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,720
the theatrical release date of december

315
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
16th 2022

316
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
we may expect some video material either

317
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,839
at the end of this year or

318
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,279
the beginning of next year how did you

319
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,399
like a new video

320
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,640

321
