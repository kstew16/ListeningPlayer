3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,639
aegon called his dream the song of ice

haven't seen the episode yet we'll just
go through shot by shot talking about

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,239
easter eggs and w tough moments as we go
along some of the references were a

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,600
little more obvious than others like
they literally say a feast for crows in

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
a song of ice and fire during the
episode everybody pointing at the screen

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
saying oh my god they said the thing but
the title of the episode is heirs of the

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,800
dragon that's a reference to the fire
and blood book that they adapted for the

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,480
show it's like a targaryen history book
written as a history book is not written

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
like a song of ice and fire where each
chapter is written from each person's

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,438
perspective but heirs of the dragon is
like literally the title of a chapter

20
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,200
from fire and blood that details what
happened to all of aegon the conquerors

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,720
heirs and the targaryen kings that came
after him so when the show begins like

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
the actual present day of the show
viserys the first targaryen is the

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,600
fourth targaryen king of westeros the
voice over at the beginning of the

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
episode during the great council of
101ac is actually coming from the older

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,119
version of rainier targaryen though
which we won't meet till like halfway

26
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,159
through the series when they do a big
time jump the version of rainier that we

27
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,799
see in this episode is like the younger
version along with the younger version

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,640
of alicent for the most part though
everybody else on the show is playing

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
the younger and the older versions of
their characters but some people who

30
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439
have seen that far ahead in the series
say that the time jump is relatively

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,040
seamless so it's not quite as weird as
it sounds when she talks about the first

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
century of the targaryen dynasty that's
just a reference to what's happened to

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,159
the realm since aegon conquered westeros
in the whole idea that leading up to

34
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,520
this event there were a lot of conflicts
like there was a lot of turmoil before

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,200
king jeharis became king but during
jiharis's reign like he's an old man

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
here during the past 50 years during his
reign there was this great period of

37
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,479
prosperity in the realm so it's kind of
like on the main show they talk about

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
all the stark children of the other
young characters being sweet summer

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,480
children because they know nothing of
winter like you were born during the

40
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,840
long summer everything has been great
while you've been alive later in the

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
episode you hear rhaenys joke about the
other young knights in the realm they

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,520
know nothing of real war they just meant
to foreshadow things eventually going

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
off the rails there are a couple battles
during this season but obviously the

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,560
real foreshadowing is for the eventual
dance of the dragons the targaryen civil

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,480
war that the show is really building up
to so the actual episode actually begins

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
with this quick flashback to the great
council of 101 ac it's at harrenhal and

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,160
notice how they got a big visual effects
upgrade like this is meant to be way

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,280
more book accurate than the version of
harrenhal that we saw during the main

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
show where king jahirus basically calls
all the lords of the realm to come have

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
a vote in who their next king is going
to be so that he can prevent a war they

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,480
pick viserys instead of rhaenys who had
been ahead of him in the line of

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,720
succession so rhaenys was the only
daughter of jihara's last surviving son

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
the previous heir who had died just
prior to this causing the big uproar

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,959
necessitating the great council jiharis
lived for a long time so he had many

55
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,120
children but most of them met either
untimely ends they were women or they

56
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,640
abdicated the throne at an early age
what ended up happening though is that

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,879
rhaenys became known as the queen who
never was because twice she was passed

58
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,760
over for the succession not just this
one time during the grand council this

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,159
was the second time it happened when her
father king jaharis's previous heir died

60
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,280
she was still in her mother's womb but
immediately upon learning of the death

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,519
jahirus passed over the unborn rhaenys
in favor of his younger son baelon

62
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,599
targaryen the only problem was is that
baelon also died an early death before

63
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,000
jiharis leading to the great council
here later rhaenys was named the queen

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,319
who never was by the court fool named
mushroom who a lot of the maesters went

65
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,680
to to chronicle the events of the
targaryen family history for fire and

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,360
blood there is no version of mushroom
that i could see during episode one i

67
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
don't know if they're going to do him as
a character during the series but it's

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,840
always possible fun fact we make a lot
of sister wiving and twin cess jokes

69
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,799
with game of thrones in house of the
dragon there's a lot of it happening

70
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,879
before your eyes in episode 1 here
really good example is viserys father

71
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,640
and mother were brother and sister
inside the line of succession so they

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,639
went full jaime and cersei but it was
actually king jaharis who legalized the

73
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,320
targaryens marrying each other within
the family that's why later when

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,520
daenerys and jon snow start getting it
on daenerys doesn't think that it's

75
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,199
weird like oh we've always done things
this way in my family but when we start

76
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,720
making all the sister-wiving jokes
obviously that led to the targaryen

77
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
madness developing because their genetic
pool just got worse and worse and worse

78
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,040
really good example of this manifesting
during the episode is viserys festering

79
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
wound on his back like he says that he
got cut by the iron throne which is also

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
a big easter egg in and of itself like
there's this belief in the realm that

81
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,199
the iron throne will basically reject
anyone who's not meant to sit on it so

82
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,000
the more you get cut by it the more
people will believe that you're not

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,520
meant to sit on it during the episode
viserys keeps talking about how he gets

84
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,199
cut by the iron throne at the end of the
episode he also gets cut again when he's

85
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,800
banishing damon targaryen but the funny
thing about this is that pretty much

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,320
anybody who sits on the iron throne gets
cut by it like it is the most stabby

87
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,080
cuddy throne that you've ever seen i'll
talk about it in a second too because

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,039
they got a huge visual upgrade like
obviously there are hundreds and

89
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,160
hundreds of swords here all over the
place as opposed to the version of the

90
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,440
iron throne we saw in the main series
there's a reason for that but the whole

91
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,960
idea here during the great council is
that rhaenys was voted down by all the

92
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,320
lords of the realm pretty much
unanimously which is why there wasn't a

93
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,840
war over the succession she just kind of
rolled with it because if she had

94
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
started a war it was basically going to
be her against the entire realm the

95
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
difference with the dance of the dragons
the targaryen civil war is that the

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
realm's allegiances were kind of split
down the middle during the last part of

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,280
the voiceover when the older rhaenyra
says that the only thing that can tear

98
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,880
down the house of the dragon is itself
she's also literally saying the name of

99
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,479
the show in her sentence here but the
voiceover is meant to foreshadow the

100
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,240
eventual dance of the dragons targaryen
civil war where literally it's targaryen

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
vs targaryen decimating their family
leading to the death of almost every

102
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,360
single one of their dragons only a few
dragons survived and most of their

103
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
family also died then the other major
change here is obviously to the actual

104
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,800
intro scene i don't know if this is
going to be the intro scene for all the

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
episodes or if it's going to be
different for episode two but obviously

106
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
it's almost like there is no intro scene
like how are we going to beat the game

107
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,560
of thrones intro scene because it was so
cool well we're not gonna do an intro

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,479
scene we'll win by not playing that game
hopefully this is just like a thing for

109
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,479
episode one and we'll get to like a more
normal intro when we get to episode two

110
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,240
most of the theme music is new but there
are a lot of songs and a lot of cues

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,520
that they use a lot of easter eggs for
music from the main series or a lot of

112
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,440
remixed music with themes from the
original series another huge change from

113
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,720
the original series is there's actual
text to sort of set you up for where

114
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,479
things begin in the timeline literally
mentioning daenerys targaryen in the mad

115
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,840
king what they're saying is that the
events of episode 1 largely take place

116
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,319
172 years before daenerys targaryen is
born and jaime lannister kills the mad

117
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,160
king her father during robert's
rebellion the actual events of game of

118
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,840
thrones episode 1 took place many years
after that then right after they

119
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,120
mentioned daenerys targaryen in that
intro scene they show rhaenyra writing

120
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,720
syrax in the sky huge visual scene
upgrade all the dragons all the special

121
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
effects because this huge upgrade but
they're playing some of daenerys

122
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,120
targaryen's theme music so they kind of
want you to think of this parallel

123
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,639
between daenerys targaryen and rainier
targaryen they are very different

124
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,599
characters like they have slightly
different personalities but they also

125
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,120
want to foreshadow that she's on a
similar path to daenerys like there's

126
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
this potential that she could either be
a really great figure or she could

127
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,120
eventually succumb to the targaryen
madness and meet a very very wtf

128
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,960
untimely end they try to give you a vibe
for her character just in general in the

129
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
first episode she's kind of like an arya
type of daenerys figure someone who's

130
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,000
very independent doesn't have a lot of
time for a lot of the courtly behavior

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,520
that people would expect of normal
highborne ladies as opposed to her best

132
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,199
friend during this period alicent
hightower who seems like she's all about

133
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,879
all this courtly behavior they give you
a quick tour of king's landing in

134
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,879
general like i said everything gets this
huge visual upgrade you see a version of

135
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,160
the dragon pit intact the version that
we saw in the main show had been

136
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
destroyed by that point of the timeline
it was actually built by king maegor

137
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,440
they referenced him a couple times in
the episode megor the cruel it was built

138
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,759
on the site of a former great sept after
the last great uprising of the faith

139
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,560
they show you some of the ways that
everyone views and treats dragons during

140
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,080
this period of the timeline they have
dragon handlers especially to take care

141
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,840
of them there the dragons respond only
to high valyrian commands because

142
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,440
obviously they come from ancient valyria
but as they say later in the episode

143
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,800
valerian the black dread is the only
living dragon or the only living thing

144
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,719
that actually survived from ancient
valeria pretty much all the other living

145
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,399
dragons that we see on the show were
born after the targaryens came to

146
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,320
dragonstone we meet graeme mctavish
who's playing harold westerling he's the

147
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,519
current lords commander of the
kingsguard we meet alicent hightower

148
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,080
like i said she's meant to be her best
friend during this period in the

149
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
timeline but obviously they're going to
show things slowly deteriorating because

150
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
alison hightower is the leader of the
greens the other faction in the dance of

151
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,640
the dragons rhaenyra being the leader of
the blacks that's why at the end of the

152
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,080
episode they show you her wearing green
literally just to kind of foreshadow

153
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,720
that eventual path previously alison was
also king jiharis's caregiver for his

154
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,480
final years so even though the high
towers in old town seem like this other

155
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,519
version of the tyrells she wears green
colors all the time kind of like the

156
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,240
tyrells her personality is nothing like
margery tyrell at least at this point

157
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,160
she's meant to be this very gentle very
nice person to everyone they take the

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,360
long way through the red keepers to give
you a quick tour of what the castle

159
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,959
looked like during the height of their
power when it was just really busy with

160
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,640
people being at court every day just
full of a small army of people all doing

161
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,839
very different types of things the room
they walk through here might also seem

162
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,120
familiar because it's the same room that
we see cersei later in the timeline

163
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,959
having the map of westeros painted on
during the main show if you pause the

164
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,760
episode while they're walking around the
castle and you kind of look around you

165
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,360
can see there are targaryen related
designs objects banners dragon related

166
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,120
everything all over the place what ended
up happening is that when robert

167
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,800
baratheon took the iron throne he
basically had anything targaryen related

168
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,399
removed from the red keep that's why a
lot of the dragon skulls that were

169
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,720
inside the throne room were moved down
below is also one of the reasons why

170
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,600
there aren't like a hundred swords
around the iron throne because when

171
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,680
robert baratheon took over he got rid of
a lot of those swords but for this show

172
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
they wanted to do a much more book
accurate version of the iron throne but

173
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,600
it's still sort of a compromise because
the actual book accurate iron throne

174
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,880
looks like this it's massive and there's
just no practical way they could

175
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,079
actually film that in these scenes but
the funny thing you may have noticed

176
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,800
here too when they're showing the iron
throne is that because they needed so

177
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
many swords they wanted to have a couple
easter eggs in the background so there

178
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,160
are swords from warcraft and the witcher
melted into this version of the iron

179
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,839
throne let me know if you actually spot
them in the episode we meet rainier's

180
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,079
mother viserys first wife emma aaron she
was a targaryen on her mother's side

181
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,560
king jiharis was also her grandfather so
for example viserys didn't sister wife

182
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,680
but he did marry his cousin
during the episode she talks about

183
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,760
having many many miscarriages and
stillbirths probably had something to do

184
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,680
with all of the sister wiving going on
in that family also there's a really

185
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,320
dark easter egg in her death during the
episode her mother also died birthing

186
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,079
her in a similar way her mother died
from sickness so she wasn't cut open but

187
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,000
she still died giving birth to her the
same way that emma died giving birth to

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,760
baelon they used this scene to kind of
give you an idea for the way ranira

189
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,959
views herself during this part of the
timeline the way that other people view

190
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,640
her like nobody thinks of her as a
potential candidate for the iron throne

191
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,839
at this point they all just kind of
expect her to have the life that normal

192
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,880
highborne ladies have like someday we're
going to marry you off to one of the

193
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,279
other powerful lords in the realm and
you're going to have a bunch of children

194
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,440
by him and most people are expecting
viserys to eventually have a son and for

195
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,279
the son to take the iron throne or for
his brother damon to take the iron

196
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,880
throne during the small council meeting
corlys velaryon mentions the triarchy

197
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,079
crab eater beginning to become a problem
down in the stepstones that's

198
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,360
foreshadowing for all the big battle
scenes we see in the trailers they will

199
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,639
definitely become a huge problem
culminating in the actual battle of the

200
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,399
stepstones but that won't happen until
way later this season the reason he's

201
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,040
called crab feeder is because he ties up
his victims in low tide so when the tide

202
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,519
comes in literal crabs will come and eat
them that's why you see all these crabs

203
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,279
crawling around here on the beach he is
literally feeding the crabs a lot of

204
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,320
these small council meeting scenes are
also meant to give you a vibe for king

205
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,639
viserys frane people generally view him
as a weak king just because he wasn't

206
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,560
really a fan of making the hard choices
that you expect kings to be able to make

207
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
he didn't want to choose his successor
to like the last possible second he

208
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,320
doesn't want to worry about the
potential threat of the triarchy he's

209
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,560
more concerned with his son's birth and
with the great tournament here he's

210
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
meant to be similar to robert baratheon
in that sense like remember during game

211
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,120
of thrones season one there was a big
tournament that's all robert cared about

212
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
even though it was bankrupting them so
you have a couple people who just were

213
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,320
not meant to actually be king when you
see rhaenyra has been serving as this cup

214
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,920
bearer this has been going on for a long
time he actually raised her at court

215
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,040
here learning all the things that you
would need to learn as the next world so

216
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,040
she was actually raised getting like the
best tutorial and how to be a good queen

217
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,320
as possible so the whole idea is there
hadn't been a battle for the succession

218
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,839
and she had become queen she actually
might have been a pretty good queen when

219
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,440
they mentioned damon targaryen in the
city watch he's the person who created

220
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
the gold cloaks like there was always a
city watch but he turned them into the

221
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,399
gold cloaks that's why in the main show
they call them the gold cloaks going

222
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,399
around the horn here lord beesbury is
the master of coin corlys velaryon is

223
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,240
the master of ships rhys ifans is
playing otto hightower he's the hand of

224
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,839
the king his older brother is lord
hightower who we meet at the end of the

225
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,560
episode ruling over the family seat in
old town

226
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,600
melos is the current grand maester and
lionel strong here is the master of laws

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,560
and i love the way they introduce you to
matt smith's damon targaryen character

228
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,240
for the first time with him sitting on
the iron throne which is like a huge

229
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,440
no-no like you can get in really big
trouble for doing stuff like that but

230
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
his nickname in westeros is the rogue
prince like he is the black sheep of the

231
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,399
family who wants nothing to do with the
normal rules of court he wants to become

232
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,920
king like he lets it be known to many
people in the episode that he expects to

233
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,160
become king and he believes that the
targaryens have become complacent and he

234
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,920
wants to take their family back to what
they were like during aegon's conquest

235
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,120
so that's one of the reasons why the
others in the small council are worried

236
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,399
about what he might do if he were to
become king like he could potentially

237
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,920
become another make or the cruel but
even though he does a lot of wtf things

238
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,839
during the episode they want to show you
that he isn't mad like megor the cruel

239
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,000
was like he's hardcore but he's not
crazy they give you a brief idea for

240
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,120
what their relationship is like like
rainier and damon both talk high

241
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,079
valyrian to each other like their own
special language even though all the

242
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,360
targaryens technically speak high
valerian some of the only things that

243
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,040
damon actually cares about in the world
are his dragon caraxies who we meet

244
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,800
during the episode and rhaenyra herself
they have this weird flirtatious

245
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,160
chemistry going on between the two of
them but he's about 12 years older and

246
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
she's actually really young at this
point in the timeline so it actually

247
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,560
takes a while before they go full jamie
and cersei but things are like slowly

248
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,079
heading in that direction we see rainier
and alicent in the godswood of king's

249
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,600
landing under the heart tree with a face
carved into it there is a god's wood in

250
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,720
king's landing you just don't see it
during the events of the main series

251
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,760
they're reading the story about nymeria
and the 10 000 ships that's kind of an

252
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,639
easter egg for them actually doing a
version of the show on hbo eventually

253
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,320
like they're actually developing a
version of a nymeria show but in this

254
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,920
scene she's also meant to be an example
of a very independent woman like rhaenyra

255
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,079
wants to become kind of like an arya
daenerys type of situation

256
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,880
when she talks about seeing the wonders
across the narrow sea she's talking

257
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,320
about essos we do see a little bit of
essos later in the series because of

258
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,680
what's happening with the triarchy also
this whole lesson that they have here

259
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
about nymeria heading to dorne being
pursued by the ancient valerians is

260
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
meant to be a reference to the fact that
in present day of the seven kingdoms

261
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,320
aegon the conqueror and the subsequent
targaryen kings up to this point haven't

262
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,880
been able to conquer dorne so right now
technically it's still the six kingdoms

263
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,160
in dorne they also set up a lot of
foreshadowing with king viserys

264
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,199
character with his festering wound from
the iron throne like i said it's meant

265
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,720
to be important of his ill health and
it's just going to continue to get worse

266
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
and worse and worse through the show
he's kind of like a sean bean type of

267
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,959
character in that way kind of like a ned
stark like oh he's clearly going to be a

268
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,600
main character then all of a sudden the
rug gets pulled out from under you like

269
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,279
up goodbye because the actual targaryen
civil war the dance of the dragons is

270
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,560
the battle for the iron throne it can't
actually begin until there is no one

271
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,160
sitting on the iron throne so he has to
die before it can start so this is like

272
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,519
this big ticking clock for his character
so don't be surprised if you see more

273
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,800
scenes where he's like wow this wound is
getting a little bit worse suddenly i

274
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,720
have this weird persistent cough they
make a reference to aima not bathing in

275
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
hot water which is meant to be a mirror
for daenerys in game of thrones episode

276
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,160
1 taking the scalding hot bath not being
burnt by fire because dragons cannot be

277
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,120
burnt by fire
they mentioned vicinia and vegard the

278
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,959
visenya they're referencing is aegon the
conqueror's sister wife visenya and

279
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,639
vegar is the current oldest living
dragon on the show because blair in the

280
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,800
black dread has died recently
viserys talks about the dragon dreams

281
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,199
that he had of his son baelon similar to
daenerys visions but just like daenerys

282
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,440
the twist here is that viserys is also
kind of misinterpreting what the visions

283
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,279
mean when he says he heard all the
sounds of battle and all the dragons

284
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,440
roaring is one he was probably actually
seeing the coming targaryen civil war

285
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,880
with everyone's dragons fighting each
other and when he says he places their

286
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
son on the iron throne eventually they
do place one of viserys's sons on the

287
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,799
iron throne but not the sun that he
thinks it's going to be then we actually

288
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,760
meet damon targaryen's new gold cloaks
versus the city watch and have this huge

289
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,599
wtf montage of them just killing as many
criminals as they can get their swords

290
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,678
on
like i said it's meant to be evidence

291
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,119
that the people in the small council use
that damon will eventually become a very

292
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,038
cruel king like maegor but also when
he's justifying his actions he's not

293
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,039
wrong like damon says we have all these
nobles coming viserys even backs him up

294
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,559
saying oh yes ever since grandmother
died king's landing has gotten worse and

295
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,919
worse and worse the grandmother he's
talking about is king jaharis's wife

296
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,280
queen alisan
probably the most wtf scene here though

297
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,799
is the dude getting his junk cut off so
rip it just reminds you of what ramsay

298
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,640
bolton did to theon greyjoy so pour one
out for them the other thing that's

299
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,160
going on here too this part of the city
is near flea bottom they also call damon

300
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,919
targaryen the lord of flea bottom so
he's like the most hated and most

301
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,440
beloved person on westeros at the same
time so like half the people really hate

302
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,559
him and the other half really love him
but the other big connection to him

303
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,600
being called the lord of flea bottom
here is because we see him in so many

304
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
brothels near this area later in the
episode there's a couple scenes to sort

305
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,400
of set up the dynamic between him and
the rest of the small council like

306
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,559
obviously otto hightower really does not
like him but the whole idea is that otto

307
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,840
hightower isn't meant to be like another
version of littlefinger or even like

308
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,480
tywin lannister but they both hate each
other with a fiery passion when damon

309
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,240
makes a joke about his wife rhea royce
she lives up near the veil that's where

310
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,600
he gets banished to by viserys at the
end of the episode the reason why he

311
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,320
doesn't really care about her is because
it's a marriage that was forced on him

312
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,200
like a lot of highborne people get
marriages forced on them just to form

313
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,960
alliances that had nothing to do with
them loving the other person speaking of

314
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,280
lovers we meet mysterio for the first
time she's gonna be a pretty big

315
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,039
character during the series her nickname
given to her by the people around her is

316
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,760
misery she's kind of like a version of
littlefinger varys and melisandre all

317
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
mixed together she eventually becomes
mistress of whispers to rainier

318
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,200
targaryen and just continues to be
daemon's lover they finally have the

319
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,559
heirs tournament is a vastly upgraded
version of the tournament that we saw in

320
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,160
game of thrones season one a lot of
familiar moments here like they show you

321
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,280
a lot of different great houses they try
to show you a much bigger version of

322
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,200
what a great tournament would look like
but mostly this is here to introduce the

323
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,520
criston cole character he's born the
steward of the current lord danderian

324
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,559
which will make you remember barrick
dindarian from the main show he's kind

325
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,840
of like a mixture of brienne of tarth
with jaime lannister like he really

326
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,559
wants to become a knight do all these
good things become a member of the

327
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,120
kingsguard like brienne does but winds
up getting mixed up in a lot of really

328
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,360
really spicy stuff classic jamie
lannister style they also want to show

329
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,640
you that he's a much better fighter than
damon targaryen which is saying a lot

330
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,520
like damon is meant to be one of the
best fighters in westeros so when

331
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,400
criston cole puts him on his ass it's a
huge deal

332
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
you also notice damon targaryen takes
the opportunity to slight otto hightower

333
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,320
as much as possible by taking out his
oldest son and asking for his daughter

334
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,320
alicent's favor i think his dragon scale
armor looks way better in the actual

335
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,760
episode than it did in all the promos
they released for the episode it's meant

336
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,799
to look very similar to the type of
armor that rhaegar wore during robert's

337
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,320
rebellion zoom in enhance you also
notice during this scene that viserys is

338
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,919
wearing the cat's paws of hilarion
dagger on him he wears it at all times

339
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
really it's the same dagger that
littlefinger used to start the war of

340
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,400
the five kings later in the timeline and
then that arya used to kill the night

341
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,640
king and for those asking yes there are
more valyrian swords like damon uses a

342
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,000
valerian sword called dark sister that
you see here he uses it a bunch of times

343
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,080
during the episode viserys wields
blackfyre aegon the conquerors former

344
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,679
sword that they passed down to each new
targaryen king there are more valerian

345
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,640
weapons flying around during this period
of the timeline some of them have not

346
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
been lost yet so like longclaw for
instance is still with house mormon so

347
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,280
the handle will still be designed to
look like a bear instead of like a

348
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,039
direwolf but when damon targaryen gives
the valerion necklace to rainier it's

349
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,280
still meant to be super rare like it's
incredibly incredibly expensive and then

350
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,120
they have a huge wtf montage with them
inner cutting the death of viserys wife

351
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,600
and his son with damon losing to criston
cole it is just meant to foreshadow the

352
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,960
beginning of the end for their family
like nothing is certain all the good

353
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,640
times that they experience under king
jiharis's rule are over for the most

354
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
part things are just going to continue
to get darker and darker and darker like

355
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,840
easy come easy go the burial scene here
even though it's very somber is meant to

356
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,600
be kind of a mirror for daenerys using
drogon to burn samwell's father and

357
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,760
brother like they buried all the
targaryens dead like this it was part of

358
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,360
their customs too and this also ties
back to aegon the conquerors prophecy of

359
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,159
a song of ice and fire the whole long
night burning your debt like

360
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,520
incinerating your dead because if you
leave someone's skeleton intact they can

361
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,440
just be raised as a white later as we
saw during later seasons like oh that's

362
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,559
why they burn their dead when they're
discussing the succession viserys

363
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,919
literally says a feast for crows which
is the title of book 4 of a song of ice

364
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,679
and fire and then when otto hightower
sends his daughter alicent to

365
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,880
quote-unquote comfort viserys it's also
kind of the beginning of their

366
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,280
relationship alison in viserys's he's in
the middle of making a replica model of

367
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,480
the ancient valyrian freehold hopefully
we'll see some flashbacks to that or

368
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,919
some more depictions of it and as he
says he's a huge history nerd he loves

369
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,840
reading the history text about ancient
valyrians the ring he's holding here

370
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,880
though what he's crying is his wife's
wedding ring that was given to her when

371
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,080
they were married the fact that she's
wearing the green dress is also meant to

372
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,440
foreshadow her eventually representing
the greens faction in the targaryen

373
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,039
civil war but there's not really that
much sinister stuff going on here like

374
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,880
otto hightower wasn't throwing her at
viserys or anything like he generally

375
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,559
thinks that he's doing what's right for
the realm right for the king and just in

376
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,080
general being good at his job issues
that slowly over time they spend more

377
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,679
and more time together eventually they
develop a relationship the demon

378
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
basically gets exiled to the veil for
insulting viserys dead son baelon and as

379
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,120
you can see it actually play out he was
mournful of them like he wasn't trying

380
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,120
to mock his dead cousin otto hightower
was just giving the information to

381
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,120
viserys out of context because obviously
he kind of hates damon and he doesn't

382
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,960
really care about him that much so damon
wasn't trying to insult baelon in this

383
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,480
moment it's just another example of
damon's big mouth getting him in trouble

384
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,360
like he still shouldn't have said it but
he didn't mean it the way that viserys

385
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,240
thinks that he meant it as they're
yelling at each other here he's holding

386
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,360
blackfyre one of the big things is that
later in the timeline eventually the

387
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,600
sword does get lost after the blackfire
rebellions and as damon leaves you can

388
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,520
see viserys get cut by the iron throne
again like i said another ill portent of

389
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,360
things to come then the scene of him
naming ranira as his heir happens in the

390
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,360
monument that they erected to belier in
the black dread his real skull after his

391
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,120
death valerion died when he was about
200 years old that's how he got so big

392
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,400
basically viserys was his last writer
but he only rode him one time so like

393
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
this whole scene here especially when
they start talking about aegon the

394
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,919
ancient valerions the song of ice and
fire the long night the night king the

395
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,440
white walkers it's just meant to be
loaded with meaning in general when he

396
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,400
talks about the doom of valeria he
implies that the valyrians caused the

397
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,360
doom because of their greatness and
their hubris thinking that they could

398
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,159
control dragons and thinking themselves
gods above everything else when really a

399
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,360
lot of people think that the doom was
caused by a lot of over mining around

400
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,440
the 14 flames the area of volcanoes and
that's what caused them to all go off

401
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,039
blowing up this entire area of the
continent they intercut the lords of the

402
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,039
realm swearing filthy to her in front of
viserys while he also reveals aegon's

403
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,720
prophecy of the long night literally
saying that aegon the conqueror's real

404
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,320
reason for conquering the seven kingdoms
was to unite the realm and create a

405
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,520
force to face the night king of the
white walkers because of a dragon dream

406
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,279
that he had like i said dragon dreams
are kind of like visions of the future

407
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,799
that they have but a lot of people can
misinterpret them in aegon literally

408
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,840
called his dream a song of ice and fire
the name of the entire book series when

409
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,360
he tells renir that this is a secret
that's passed from targaryen king to

410
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,520
each targaryen king the way george r
martin clarified it is that when aegon

411
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,720
had the dream and tried to unite the
seven kingdoms thinking about the long

412
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,400
night nobody actually knew when it was
going to happen so each new targaryen

413
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,360
king when they learned about it and kind
of took up the mission as their own

414
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,159
thought that it was right around the
corner nobody knew it was going to be

415
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,760
almost 200 years before it actually
happened but also part of the idea here

416
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,279
is that had the dance of the dragons not
happen and like had they not killed off

417
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,320
half their family and most of their
dragons the realm probably would have

418
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,320
been much better equipped to fight the
night king in the white walkers damon

419
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,600
then takes his dragon caraxes and
miseria back to the veil that's probably

420
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,039
not gonna stick for that long and just
after he tells her the prophecy of a

421
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,559
song of ice and fire they end the
episode with her facing camera in the

422
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,240
theme song from the main show plays
called a song of ice and fire like the

423
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,159
actual song is named a song of ice and
fire it played in the very last episode

424
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,679
of game of thrones in the outro but if
you spotted any other big easter eggs or
