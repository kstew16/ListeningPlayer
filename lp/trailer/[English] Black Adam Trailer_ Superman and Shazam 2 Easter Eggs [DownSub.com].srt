1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,960
My son sacrificed his life to save me

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,520
these powers are not a gift but a curse

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,983
born out of rage

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,280
this loose cannon needs to be locked down 
before innocent people start getting hurt  

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,840
he's been asleep for 5 000 years  

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,880
you find us a cell that can hold them we'll 
take care of the rest who's on the team

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,760
i didn't bring a passport we don't need passports

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,840
we're the justice society

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,624
here we go

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,178
or you can be its savior

11
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,840
Welcome back everyone it's charlie this will be 
my new black adam trailer video there's a whole  

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,400
bunch of easter eggs here connecting it to the 
other dc eu movies so we'll break it all down  

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
if you're brand new to the channel be sure to 
subscribe to get all the videos they're also  

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,600
having a big disney plus day this weekend with 
a bunch of marvel trailers probably some star  

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,760
wars trailers i'll be doing videos for all that 
stuff as well too the big thing in this trailer  

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,080
is revealing the actual main villain of the film 
like black adam is the anti-hero of the film so  

17
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,000
you have to have somebody in the movie that's 
even worse for him to go up against eventually  

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,040
and that's going to be the sabac character from 
the shazam comics they also show you a bunch more  

19
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,200
of the justice society in their mansion from 
the comics it's like an upgraded version that  

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,000
you imagine that they would do in live action we 
saw some interiors of it briefly in the previous  

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,680
trailers but now we get like the full shot and 
they kind of do the x-men thing in the original  

22
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,280
x-men films where literally like the yard opens up 
to an actual hangar bay it gave me classic x-men  

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,400
vibes with the x-jet coming out of the basketball 
court the other big thing here too we find is that  

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,720
amanda waller has a big cameo scene it's meant to 
take place after the events of the suicide squad  

25
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,240
movie in peacemaker but she's the person that 
calls the justice society to go take care of black  

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,720
adam when people find out that he's come back 
so the whole idea is that she's not sending them  

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,880
to take care of sabach like that hasn't become a 
thing yet inner gang seems like they're trying to  

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,440
resurrect spock and use his powers it sounds like 
at the beginning of the movie they unwittingly  

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,720
unleash black adam like adriana tomas's 
character unleashes him using this spell here  

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,520
then amanda waller finds out about it at argus and 
she calls the justice society to take care of it  

31
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,360
they do probably have a reason for amanda waller 
not calling the justice league and it's probably  

32
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,200
because they don't want to have anything to do 
with her like in the past we saw her have most  

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,680
of her dealings with batman but even with all the 
craziness that's happening in the flash movie in  

34
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,080
the flashpoint storyline that they're doing like 
they're messing a little bit with the timeline  

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,160
after the fact amanda waller is so shady batman 
probably doesn't want to have anything to do  

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,680
with her and the other justice league characters 
wouldn't either like superman wouldn't want to  

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,400
deal with amanda waller the rock has been hyping 
up black adam versus superman in the future and  

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,680
there is supposed to be some kind of henry cavill 
superman cameo scene at the end the same way that  

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,600
he had a cameo scene at the end of the first 
shazam movie but the way the rock explained it  

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,760
is that after black adam gets released from his 
prison he's been gone for five thousand years so  

41
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,560
he comes out not knowing anything about any of 
the justice league characters he might know a  

42
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,720
little bit about wonder woman in the amazonians 
but that'd probably be it there is this whole  

43
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,520
sequence where amanda waller talks about actually 
capturing black adam and holding him in a prison  

44
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,080
then you see all these scenes seemingly a 
black adam without his powers wearing his  

45
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,600
ancient clothing from kondok stuck underwater and 
that might be how they capture him like somehow he  

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,040
might say his power word which is shazam like the 
shazam characters which deactivates his abilities  

47
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,000
but the big thing in the comics is that he rarely 
rarely does this like he never wants to turn his  

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,720
powers off like usually if that happens someone 
tricks him into doing it because this is meant  

49
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,280
to be black adam held in prison without his powers 
he looks way less swole than this version of black  

50
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,440
adam they might just be playing it this way for 
a big reveal when he says his power word again  

51
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,640
activating his powers and bursts out in this huge 
explosion making it a big wtf moment in the movie  

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,040
but i think the whole idea is then presenting 
the choice to him whether or not he's going to  

53
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,280
actually help them or if he's just going to ignore 
the problem and do his own thing and try to take  

54
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,240
over kondok when dr fate is talking about choosing 
different paths the whole idea with his character  

55
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,120
is that one of his abilities in the movie at least 
is that he has seen visions of the future and he's  

56
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,880
basically talking about this apocalypse and he's 
not talking about the one that we see during  

57
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,720
the justice league snyder cut because that's 
also an apocalypse of a very different kind  

58
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,880
make all the dark side apocalypse references 
you want because apocalypse and apocalypse  

59
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,000
two completely different ideas but you do see the 
similarity in the name of the apocalypse planet to  

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,280
the actual idea of destruction apocalypse usually 
in the comics they play in this way like very dark  

61
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,160
anti-hero he'll usually work against the heroes 
a lot of times but then eventually when the chips  

62
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,880
are dead like when is really needed he will help 
them out begrudgingly i think that's one of the  

63
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,600
other reasons why they included hawkman instead 
of hog girl during the movie because either one  

64
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,680
would work just based on the explainer here the 
fact that they resurrect they would still be alive  

65
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,960
in present day because they want you to identify 
more with this hardcore mindset and hawkman is  

66
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,720
way way more hardcore in the comics than hot girl 
usually he's the guy that you have to stop from  

67
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,880
wrecking everything in sight and that's kind of 
the same vibe with black adam during the movie  

68
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,440
he just wants to mow through everybody that's in 
his way i'll explain the differences between the  

69
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,000
justice society of the dcu and what they've been 
doing this whole time like in the timeline of the  

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,360
dc eu while the justice league has been operating 
because within the context of the dceu movies with  

71
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,680
the exception of the wonder woman movie which 
obviously takes place in the distant past most  

72
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,160
of what happens with the justice league forming 
actually happens relatively close to present day  

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,400
in the version of the justice society that we 
meet at the beginning of the movie is hawkman  

74
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,600
and dr fate and they're like the remnants of an 
older team that mostly died off through the course  

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,680
of their adventures and they're the two ones 
that have just survived to present day and they  

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,320
reformed the team with cyclone and adam smasher 
the new young people the big thing with the sabog  

77
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,360
villain that's similar to the shazam characters is 
that just like the gods that give shazam and black  

78
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,600
adam their powers like their names are acronyms 
they get their powers from different gods the  

79
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,240
title of the shazam movie is literally fury of the 
gods and it's all about the daughters of atlas one  

80
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,920
of the gods that gives shazam his powers trying to 
take the power back for themselves obviously black  

81
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,080
adam is connected to the shazam movies even though 
they're not going to have like a giant crossover  

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,000
for at least a couple more movies you can see how 
they're trying to make a lot of the easter eggs  

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,560
and connections and the lore in both of the movies 
line up with each other so that when they do cross  

84
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,960
over everything makes sense like the timeline 
will make sense the sabak villain is kind of  

85
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,840
like a demon that does the same thing as the gods 
that the shazam characters get their powers from  

86
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,080
he can grant people powers of the same way but 
what might be happening in the movie is that  

87
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,280
either he himself finds a way to walk the planet 
and wants to just take it over himself or he picks  

88
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,160
an avatar and just takes over their body and then 
tries to take over the world one of the other big  

89
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,840
changes that some of you may have noticed in this 
trailer from the previous ones is that they've  

90
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,440
completely changed the color correction so all the 
footage doesn't have this weird orange cast to it  

91
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,240
they also added some subtitles to black adam 
when he's speaking to them in kondok like he's  

92
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,920
using the kondok language when he's talking 
to these other mercenaries taking them out  

93
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,080
your magic is weak when they're trying to kill 
him with the bullets the voice over from the woman  

94
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,840
in the trailer taking the black adam for test 
calling him on his bullcrap like you're only here  

95
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,160
for revenge you don't want to do anything good 
that's probably adriana tomasz's character and  

96
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,360
she's probably the one that brings him around on 
actually helping them out by the end of the movie  

97
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,160
because she and her little brother are meant to 
remind him of his former wife and son who died in  

98
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,200
the past if you haven't read the comics there's a 
long time romance between adriana tomas and black  

99
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,280
adam in present day they become lovers and he 
grants some of his power to her there's like a  

100
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,600
whole story line i don't know if they're going to 
do any of that in the movies maybe they do sequels  

101
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,680
i don't think we'll see that during this movie 
they kind of just use that idea during thor love  

102
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,560
and thunder with thor sharing his power with other 
people but that is basically what shazam does in  

103
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,200
the shazam movies and you see it more during the 
shazam 2 trailer the whole idea that he shared his  

104
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,240
power with the rest of the family so even though 
each one is weaker by default just because he's  

105
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,080
shared a certain amount of power with them when 
they're able to work together they're much more  

106
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,960
effective in a fight than like a single person 
like black adam that's why when they fight him  

107
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,200
the only times they're usually able to defeat 
him is when they all work together at the same  

108
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,440
time but part of the comedy of the shazam movies 
like obviously the tone is very different from the  

109
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,120
black adam movie is that they're still kind 
of learning how to do that but i think when  

110
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,360
we get to the events of shazam too the family 
has spent a little bit more time working with  

111
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,080
their powers and they've got at least a little bit 
better as for all the big changes at dc right now  

112
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,080
like there's this new 10-year plan they're still 
looking for their kevin feige reportedly they  

113
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,120
almost found someone named dan lin who had worked 
at some of the previous dc movies like he actually  

114
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,600
worked on the george miller version of the justice 
league movie back during the early 2000s when  

115
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,800
that was still a thing reportedly that deal fell 
through and dc warner brothers are still looking  

116
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,840
for their kevin feige person so we'll find out 
who that is sometime in the next six months or so  

117
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,440
i don't think they've formally announced it 
yet but they might wind up delaying shazam  

118
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,720
two fury of the gods because they don't want to 
compete with avatar two that disney is releasing  

119
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,560
but if they delay that it'll probably just be 
by a couple months like it won't be that long  

120
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,560
and even though there is all the craziness with 
ezra miller i've already done a video about that  

121
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,040
because the flash series is ending basically 
around the same time that they were originally  

122
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,120
going to release the flash movie but if they delay 
all the dc movies next year by a couple months  

123
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,040
that's obviously going to change just a little bit 
too the timing is a little bit weird like you end  

124
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,480
the flash series and then you have the flash movie 
like right after that is there going to be any  

125
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,800
kind of cameo scene going on there there have been 
reports that warner brothers does want to do more  

126
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,120
with henry cavill and we talked about him cameoing 
in the black adam movies because it sounds like  

127
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,120
the rock really wants to do something with 
him in the movies there have been all kinds of  

128
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,080
rumors about that i don't know which are true and 
which are false reportedly henry cavill has his  

129
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,160
own plans for the future of superman and warner 
brothers and him just can't come to an agreement  

130
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,560
yet so a lot of that is still up in the air like 
he could come back in cameos but he could also  

131
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,760
really fully come back and do more full-blown 
superman movies if we get any more information  

132
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,120
about that in the next couple months of course 
i'll release a video about it but i will do  

133
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,200
more black adam trailer videos and easter eggs 
for the movie as it slowly comes out there'll  

134
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,280
be more trailers as we get a little bit closer 
i'll post all my marvel trailers this weekend
