1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,380
foreign

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,300
since Michael Myers vanished Without a

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,540
Trace

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,660
I'll

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,800
I was certain but I saw him

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,020
watching me

7
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,460
you pretend like you moved on but you're

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,800
actually just obsessed with death what

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,360
are you gonna do when Michael comes back

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,160
for you because he is coming

11
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,200
but this time

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,780
something feels different

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,500
he's more dangerous

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,939
he killed my daughter but tonight I will

15
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,280
kill him come and get me

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,759
maybe the only way he can die is if I

17
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,939
die too it all ends now

18
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,860
you came here to kill me so do it

19
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,480
there's a lover in the story but the

20
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,580
story is still the same there's a

21
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,459
lullaby for suffering and a paradox to

22
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,800
blame I didn't know I had permission

23
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,700
you want it darker

24
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,420
we kill the flame

25
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,020
you don't think I'm a bad person

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,860
you look like the kind that's convinced

27
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,360
himself he's got this under his thumb

28
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,319
I'm ready

29
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,560

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,580
vilified crucified in the human frame

31
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,920
you want it darker

32
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,360
we kill the flame

33
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,099
many love will set you free

you're a terrible liar and that's kid

40
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,640
I've always imagined that my life was

41
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,220
like a typical romantic comedy you were

42
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,720
so confident and you just ripped off

43
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,980
your clothes like your strippered a

44
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,720
bachelorette party and I basically

I'm afraid the news isn't good

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,240
I was always afraid kit would break my

67
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,120
heart and eventually he did he broke it

68
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,300

you have to run the race in front of you

71
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,940
because that's all there is look back

72
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,100
this is less of a rom-com and more of a

73
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,900
love story you can't sit for four hours

74
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,580
with promised bed all the beds are

75
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,800

ass looks in your khaki pants I was

80
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,039
afraid if you understood how beautiful

you are if you'd leave me thank you for

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,960
inviting us it was Kit's idea I was

83
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,139
vehemently opposed to it

84
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,539
and like all love stories it never

85
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,380

important job to do

113
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,660

and are united by a common vision

117
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,560
which has now become a command

118
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760

119
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,180
