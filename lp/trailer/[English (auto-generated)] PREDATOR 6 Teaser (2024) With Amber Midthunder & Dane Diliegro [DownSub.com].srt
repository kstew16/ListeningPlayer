33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,700
the movie was criticized for the cast

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,740
section which was composed of many

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,380
unknown names the film is now receiving

41
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,460
director Dan trattenberg many critics

42
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,860
even say that prey is already the best

43
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,659
Predator installment since the first

44
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,420
film and what makes this film so special

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,479
simply it has a great story in it gray

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,460
showed you that you don't need to have a

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,799
big budget to achieve great goals the

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,500
movie managed to achieve a 7.2 rating on

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,759
IMDb in a fantastic 77 audience score on

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,579
Rotten Tomatoes only one month after the

51
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,920
premiere for example the Predator from

52
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,220
2018 was a big budget attempt to revive

53
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,139
the frame franchise and bring it back on

54
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,360
the throne but it turned out to be only

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,120
a critical and financial dud the newest

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,099
Predator movie went back to what made

57
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,260
the original Predator movie work the

58
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,360
fight between nauru with a so-called

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
feral Predator who comes to Earth

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,739
seeking worthy trophies is characterized

61
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,840
as good as the first Predator movie with

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,120
Arnold Schwarzenegger Jesse Ventura and

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,340
Carl Weathers in the leading roles these

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,620
legendary actors are the real culprits

65
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,540
who hit that like button just like you

66
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,300
should if you haven't done so already no

67
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,220
really these actors are the real

68
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,500
culprits who made Predator story so

69
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,360
popular and one of the longest living

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,300
movie franchise on the big screens after

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,400
this legendary presentation of the story

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
in front of the audience we watched

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,780
three sequels the alien creature came

74
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,840
again in 1990 in Predator 2 and again in

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,720
2010 in predators and the last one we

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,700
already mentioned was the Predator from

77
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,760
2018. this franchise also included two

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,459
movie Specialties Alien vs Predator in

79
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,200
Alien vs Predator Requiem in 2004 and

80
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,300
2007. in total the movies grossed over

81
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,239
750 million dollars at the end of the

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,819
last movie prey everything was left open

83
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,040
and many Mysteries still need to be

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,319
exposed including the one about the gun

85
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,959
leaving a very wide open door for a

86
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,060
possible sequel let's see if there is

87
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,980
any potential release date for the prey

88
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,260
sequel the development of prey started

89
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,080
even before the premiere of 2018's The

90
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,060
Predator when the director trottenberg

91
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,459
approached the producer John Davis and

92
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,379
met a win the concept on which he has

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,980
been working on since 2016. then in 2020

94
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,500
the film title was revealed which was

95
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,599
also criticized because there were four

96
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,280
other movies in the past with the same

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,560
name there is a German survival Thriller

98
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,379
a horror movie prey from 2019. one

99
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,299
that's Spanish from the same year and

100
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,900
also Norman J Warren's movie prey from

101
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,580
1977. the filming for the fifth Predator

102
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,739
installment took place in Calgary Canada

103
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,739
during this summer of 2021 and it was

104
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,260
wrapped by September now fans of the

105
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,599
franchise are constantly asking if there

106
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,459
will be a sequel for the prequel story

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,100
to clear things up the film producer

108
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,079
John Davis recently in an interview

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,540
confirmed that he does have plans for a

110
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,240
possible sequel or a possible Predator 6

111
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,600
movie so after prey succeeded in just a

112
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,880
month to revive the franchise things

113
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,740
seem to be very bright for the future

114
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,440
some leaks are saying that in the case

115
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,419
of a renewal the release date for the

116
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,160
prey sequel will be known at the

117
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,520
earliest in mid of 2024. now let's see

118
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,259
if there is any information about who

119
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,540
may return to reprise their roles in the

120
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,639
potential six Predator movie the cast

121
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,040
crew and prey was maybe not so familiar

122
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,139
to the audience but they surely were

123
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,880
aware of the burden they had to carry

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,919
for this kind of movie franchise the

125
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,960
young but extra talented Amber mid

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
Thunder was playing the main role of

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,699
nauru Dan delegriot who is a former

128
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,259
basketball player was wearing the

129
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,600
clothes of the predator and stormy Kip

130
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,460
who became known to the audience from

131
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,919
the movie sui played fellow Comanche

132
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,620
Warrior Wasabi we also saw the musician

133
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,080
Dakota beavers as the Comanche Warchief

134
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,540
Toddy and Stephanie Matthias as the

135
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,639
chief wife Sumo we know that the

136
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,039
Predator killed Wasabi and the war chief

137
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,500
tabi so they probably won't come back to

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
reprise their roles a lot of other

139
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,220
Comanche warriors were killed in the

140
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,139
fight with the mighty creature we can't

141
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,180
be sure who is and who is not coming

142
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,639
back to reprise their role but it's sure

143
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,560
that now is the right time for you to

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,419
smash that subscribe button and hit that

145
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,759
notification Bell below the video no

146
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,100
really it's almost sure that we will see

147
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,039
some new faces if the sequel of prey is

148
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,080
going to happen there are a lot of

149
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,060
Native American actors that could join

150
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,160
the cast if the movie stays in the same

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
period last but not least let's see what

152
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,900
we can expect from the story in the

153
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,300
potential sixth film The Predator films

154
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,220
had some strange Journey since the

155
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,320
original was released with many rotating

156
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
protagonists said settings and enemies

157
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,460
the last movie was another one in the

158
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,840
sequence of these twists in the

159
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,000
scenarios the longtime producer of The

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,340
Predator movies John Davis who has been

161
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,080
involved in the franchise since the

162
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,780
first movie in 1987. recently for

163
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,240
variety commented on the success of prey

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,860
and he also commented on the

165
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,660
possibilities for future adaptations

166
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,819
Davis said that the creatures could

167
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,460
appear in every period Well maybe

168
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,800
there's an origin story right maybe

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,900
there's another Alien vs Predator story

170
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,880
in a different situation and maybe

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,100
there's a new modern day version and

172
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,780
maybe there's something somewhere in

173
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,060
between I think this character can show

174
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,520
up throughout history he said on the

175
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,800
other side director tritenberg more

176
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,960
precisely a seat that he is open to the

177
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,419
idea of a new movie in an interview with

178
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,060
time out he said there are a lot of

179
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,280
exciting ideas for what could be for the

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,020
next franchise the things that most

181
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,720
excite me are the bodus wings and I

182
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,340
think there's scope to do other things

183
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,500
that haven't been done before if you

184
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,780
analyze these comments you will conclude

185
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,580
that it seems the Predator franchise

186
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,400
will continue in some other ambient in

187
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,500
some other period but still the end

188
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,840
credits of prey suggest that the Saga

189
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,000
will continue with a sequel at the end

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,160
of the movie the young Warrior girl will

191
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,259
use the Predator's technology to kill

192
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,479
the creature she will return to her

193
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,400
tribe with a predator's head and will

194
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,500
celebrate with her people but she will

195
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,840
urge them that they must react quickly

196
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,180
because out there is still a threat

197
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,919
maybe she thinks about the French

198
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,199
Trapper she met before and killed some

199
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,300
of them but we know that this Predator

200
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,699
is not the last of its kind as the story

201
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,819
happens in 1719 and we already know that

202
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,680
the creatures who are hungry for human

203
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
trophies will also show up in modern

204
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,960
times so guys stay patient because very

205
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,940
soon we will know how the Saga will

206
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,919
continue the story and the producers

207
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,139
will probably wait a few more months to

208
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,060
analyze the success of their recently

209
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,400
released movie and then the answers will

210
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,680
come thanks for watching we'll see you

211
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,099
next time

212
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,300
foreign
