1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,660
In a world of Heroes

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,040
and Villains

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,500
one power ruled all Black Adam

4
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,560
has been asleep for 5,000 years

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,460
we are here to negotiate your
peaceful surrender I am not peaceful

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,080
nor do I surrender

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,558
my powers are not a gift

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,799
but a curse

9
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:44,450
born of rage

10
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:53,737
You have two choices  .  You can be the destroyer of this world.  Or it can be, it is savior.

11
00:00:55,698 --> 00:01:00,000
It is his darkness that allows him to do what heroes cannot.

12
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,644
The battle you're meant to fight is upon us

13
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,320
there's no one on this planet that can stop me

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,100
Welcome everyone I'm Charlie this will be
my new Black Adam trailer video, they released a

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,060
Black Adam Justice League Trailer,  there's a
ton of footage we'll break it all down if you're

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,420
new to the channel the movie is coming out
very soon i'll make videos for it like i do

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,560
for all the other great movies make sure you subscribe
to get them.  I'm doing a raffle for movie tickets.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,120
when we zoom in a little bit closer obviously
this new trailer is a big black adam against

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,200
the justice league typographical trailer like they're
leaning heavily on the association between black adam

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,880
character in justice league four
important reasons i will explain some of you have been

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,660
thinking about this ever since
the black adam movie was announced but the other funny thing that may have

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,980
what just happened is that when they released
the promo they actually removed the official one.

23
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,600
the promo changed it a little bit like they did a
new edit and then reuploaded it the rock even

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,820
posted corrected so when it says corrected what it
means is that the original version of the promo had a

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,040
scene from the Joss Whedon version  from the Justice
League movie and they just re-released one without her

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,120
the footage they removed was basically like
a scene from Joss Whedon's version of Steppenwolf

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,500
swinging his ax and I guess people went crazy for
that I didn't actually see  people coming to

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,120
complain about it i only saw it after they reuploaded the new one
it actually took me a little while to figure it out

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,720
what had happened like wait a minute why did
they reupload it what was wrong with the first one it

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,500
turns out that  there was a bunch
of theatrical Justice League footage that people just

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,820
really didn't like they basically just cut it out
and then re-uploaded it Warner Brothers

32
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,920
said something weird about it  e not using
snyder cut footage in a lot of their current movies like

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,240
that is why you don't see a lot
of snyder cut stuff within the actual upcoming movies a

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,980
lot of the movies reference other movies like
yagadas wonder woman actually film  new scenes

35
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,660
for Shazam Fury the Gods like she's in that movie as
well and I think the

36
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,120
main reason the reason they don't use a lot of cut footage of Snyder in
their promos is particularly for financial

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
reasons that I think she has something to  do with the
contracts between the two different versions

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,560
of Justice League and it's easier for them
at the corporate level not to address as just

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,940
dodge the issue but the other fun thing
they do during this Justice League promo is

40
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,020
they don't  they included footage of the
actual Joker even though they're referencing him like they

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,920
included footage of Harley Quinn
blowing up chemicals here  monkeys that were meant to be

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,660
she blew up the joker's hideout in the
birds of prey movie like it was a joker scene

43
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,800
without the real joker because it was meant to
be jared leto's joker and i think the reason

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,300
they did it because  they're not totally
sure what they're going to do with the DC EU remake the

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,460
joker likes to make it sound like they don't want
to bring jared leto back as dceu joker so they're

46
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,360
gonna have to re-release at some point and
they're just not ready to do it yet because joaquin

47
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,620
phoenix is ​​joker the new
todd phillips joker sequel will probably blow up like

48
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,340
the first one and the fun of that is
he's meant to be in his own little universe

49
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,660
todd phillips has become so powerful because
his  movies have been so successful in the first

50
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,360
The Joker movie was so successful that he and Joaquin
Phoenix got crazy contracts for the sequel so

51
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,440
basically they become so powerful that Warner
Brothers can't tell them you have to do it.

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,660
within the dceu like he doesn't cross over unless
Todd Phillips wants him to cross over it's the

53
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,560
same kind of thing with the Matt Reeves version of
Batman Robert Pattinson's Batman he wants

54
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,280
it to be like his own little separate universe
so  they're protecting it even though they

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,180
just had all this
crazy corporate level stuff going on like the whole debacle with

56
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,560
the batgirl movie but the other big reason why they
released a black adam vs justice league

57
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,320
trailer kind of  the Black Adam movie movie
is because currently the rock is releasing a

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,760
Black Adam versus Justice League movie that
I talked about earlier but now we just learned

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,660
a little bit more about it when they first announced that
the  movie The Rock was making all these references

60
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,740
to Black Adam fighting a version of Henry Cavill's Superman
like he wanted to get a version of that

61
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,520
movie going but just for  the way
things worked in the last two years,

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,780
it couldn't be the first movie, that's why Sabaka is
probably the villain of this first movie.

63
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,560
that it was just Superman because it would have
been a pretty awesome movie but during one of the

64
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,880
first promos they released for the actual movie
it literally put the Justice League on notice

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,200
as in the promo he specifically called them out
as if the hierarchy of  DC EU was going to change

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,500
everyone has been posting memes on that line but
before I go I want you to help me with

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,760
something it's something that's pretty important
I need you to help me send a message to

68
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:15,000
uh some of the other some of the
other dc superheroes let's flash shazam

69
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:26,700
aquaman wonder woman batman and superman let them
know things will never be the same

70
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,640
because the hierarchy of power in
the dc universe is about to change

71
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,580
the funny thing about that is people  it's
like why didn't he mention cyborg what is he?

72
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,600
going on with cyborg isn't he part of this
too who knows what's going on with that but

73
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,800
the reason he's doing that is because he's
trying to get interest in a black adam versus

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,620
justice league movie at dc reports recently  that they
've been calling it Black Adam versus the

75
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,760
Justice League versus Suicide Squad it's kind
of a Mexican three-way matchup where I eat

76
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,660
each three separate forces even though Black Adam
doesn't technically have a team with him like he's

77
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,520
Black Adam for  itself was the three
different forces in dceu kind of converge

78
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,480
and go against each other it looks like it's going to take
a while for him to figure out what he's going to do that

79
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,800
will eventually be and probably won't be the next
black adam movie that would be like the  third or

80
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,460
fourth movie that they're working on, but that's the
main reason why they're seeing the rock talk

81
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,080
about the Justice League so much even though they're
featuring the So  Justice Society during this movie

82
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,220
we will probably also see spin-offs
for the Justice Society at some point in the future.

83
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,780
the whole arc of the black adam movie is
the justice society convincing him to help them and

84
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,160
what will probably happen at the end of this first
movie is that he will end up defeating subak in

85
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,300
then just like in the comics the next
thing he will do  is to take control of a conduct and rule it

86
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,500
with an Iron Fist and just kick out
everyone he doesn't like usually he only cares about himself

87
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,040
business and conduct ruling his own people
like he doesn't get involved in international affairs  .

88
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,740
matters unless it involves some
larger magical problem potentially threatening behavior that

89
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,940
ends up happening in the story line they
tease in the first post-credits scene of the movie Shazam

90
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,740
with Mr Mind, the idea being that he wants to
use Dr. Savannah  to take over the magical lands

91
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,360
Seven Kingdoms of magic that are like an
Alternate Dimension this is like pure magic if they

92
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,400
were able to make him become a powerful god
and threaten all of reality basically Black Adam

93
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,640
ended up getting involved in the arc of that  comic book
so it looks like they're going to do it for the third time

94
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,180
shazam movie like they pay for that
post credit scene and black adam will get involved

95
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,860
in that and that's going to be his big
black adam vs shazam crossover but early prediction unless he

96
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,940
just sees completely  to the left and do
something completely different than what they will do

97
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,500
is at the end of that
Black Adam Shazam crossover movie where they deal with Mr Mind in the  Seven

98
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,720
Kingdoms of Magic is there's going to be some
bigger fallout that's going to affect the main Earth then

99
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,220
the Justice League is going to get involved and that's
what you're going to see Black Adam vs Justice League but

100
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,300
I think the whole Arc of that would be similar
to  Arc of this first Black Adam movie where

101
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,160
as the Justice Society comes to try to win him over,
please help us, we know he doesn't like us, but we

102
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,780
need you to stop a bigger threat, only this
time it will be Superman who does it

103
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,040
as Superman  he fights to a stop and as
he does so while they're busy beating up

104
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,420
the [ __ ] on each other all over the Earth he tries
to explain that you have to stop doing this there's a

105
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,140
bigger threat that we all have to come together
to fight that happened during the  Justice is coming

106
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,640
a league movie like Darkseid and everybody has
to come together but like I said usually the only

107
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,200
time Black Adam gets involved as the
reason it would be a Black movie  adam justice league is

108
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,700
because it's related to magic and speaking of henry
cavill coming back as superman someone actually

109
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,320
did a funny trailer edit of superman vs black
adam based on that recent black adam promo like

110
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,440
no one can stop me like oh no one except superman
there's no one on this planet that can stop me

111
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,600
if y'all didn't know too much henry cavill
has actually been using the management of The Rock

112
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,740
company for much of his business as an
actor that's why you see pictures of the two of them

113
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,300
together they're bros now  , but there's also
business on the side that they have together so

114
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,020
the main idea right now is that The Rock
is trying to get this Black Adam vs.

115
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,640
Justice League movie down the road is the best
chance Henry Cavill has of  coming back as

116
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,480
superman the other funny thing i didn't mention
earlier is if you realize that

117
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,740
justice league promo didn't include footage of the
flash i think for obvious reasons  ways, better leave it.

118
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,020
that was kept under wraps until next year until they have to
market that movie out of sight but out of mind but

119
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,460
when it comes to the actual DC EU flash i think ezra
miller is out no matter how they release

120
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,120
the movie no  they're going to take him out
or anything like that or remake the movie

121
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,800
in some way and after the movie comes out
he won't come back as The Flash in any big DC

122
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,940
projects like they'll just let the character sit
dormant for a while and then probably  bring

123
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,920
in a recast version or bring in another flash
like Wally West I did a video a while ago about

124
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,880
this big 10 year plan that the CEO of Warner Brothers has
because of all these mergers that have been

125
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,500
going on the last two years we'll see what
ends up happening  in the next few years, but it's

126
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,340
great to find out that The Rock really wants to
have more Justice League stuff in the

127
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,540
dceu I think of all the projects that are coming out
now between him and Shazam  Fury of the Gods

128
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,820
those are like the best chance for the DCEU to
continue as you know it right now even though they're

129
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,960
probably going to reprise some of the
actors at some point some will stay

130
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,160
some will be recast and then  some will be
Multiverse versions if there are any of the big easter eggs you

131
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,280
saw in the trailer something I didn't talk about
in the video or any other big questions

132
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,080
about Black Adam's future in the DCEU
just write it down in the comments my next one

133
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,220
big video will be episode 6 of House of the Dragon.
